# Focus on float window with dialog

Use this keymap to focus on the float window with dialog:

```lua
vim.keymap.set(
  "n",
  "<space>zz",
  "<cmd> lua vim.diagnostic.open_float()<cr><cmd>lua vim.diagnostic.open_float()<cr>",
  { silent = true }
)
```
## Description

This keymap enables you to quickly focus on the float window with dialog in Neovim. It combines commands to open the float window with dialog, improving your coding workflow.

## Usage

Press `Space zz` in Normal mode to activate the keymap and perform the following actions:
## Explanation

- The command `vim.keymap.set("n", "<space>zz", ...)` sets up a keymap binding in Neovim's Normal mode.
- When you press `Space zz`, the keymap executes the following commands sequentially:
  - `vim.diagnostic.open_float()` opens the float window with dialog.
  - `vim.diagnostic.open_float()` opens the float window with dialog again (repeated for clarity).

This keymap is useful for quickly focusing on the float window with dialog, allowing you to efficiently manage code feedback and issues.
